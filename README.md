# ZMP-Preview-Control-WPG
ZMP Preview Control Walking Pattern Generation for Biped Humanoid Robot

This is a source code of biped walking pattern generator with ZMP preview control.
The source code is written in Matlab and Python. 
Matlab is used to calculate gain matrix then Python is used to simulate the system by feedforward control.
